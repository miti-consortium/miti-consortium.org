## Agenda and Discussion

### Governance Board Election
-   Current board members (Denis Schapiro, Adam Taylor, Sarah Arena) will continue to serve for a new term.
-   We will continue to build community and recruit new members who are enthusiastic about taking on specific tasks or projects.
-   The role of the governance board is to respond to community feedback and revisions. The current board's focus is to continue with outreach activities and work on technical features. 

### Next Steps
